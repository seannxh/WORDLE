## How to Play:

You are tasked with guessing a 5-letter word.

There are over 5000 words in the dictionary that are 5 letters long.

To simply input your letts please click on the webpage keyboard and press "Enter" to submit your guess!

You have 6 attempts to guess the word correctly.

* If a tile turns white or light gray, the letter is not part of the word.
* If a tile turns blue, the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
* If a tile turns purple, the letter is in the word and in the correct position.

This game challenges your word-guessing skills against a predefined list of 5-letter words.

* If you cannot get the word correct or have a difficult time to save time you can press the "Give Up" button to reveal the answer

* If you have gotten the word correct and want a new word to guess please click on "New Word" button!

* If you are having trouble and want to reset your score and restart the game please click on "Restart" button!
